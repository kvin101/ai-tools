# OpenAI Tips & Tricks

Unlock the full potential of OpenAI models with these actionable tips and prompt-writing strategies.

## Write Clear Prompts
- Be specific about the task, format, and constraints.
- Use step-by-step instructions for complex tasks.
- Provide sample input and desired output when possible.

## Use System Messages

## Experiment and Iterate
- Try different phrasings and compare results.
- Adjust parameters for more control (temperature, max tokens, etc).

## Advanced Usage
- Chain prompts for multi-step workflows.
- Use OpenAI for code review, data analysis, and creative brainstorming.
- Ask for explanations, code comments, or alternative solutions.

## Troubleshooting
- If results are off-topic, rephrase your prompt or add more context.
- Use shorter prompts for more focused answers.
